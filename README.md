# Basic-Python-Calculator
The Basic Python Calculator is a simple command-line program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to choose an operation, input two numbers, and displays the result.
Certainly! Here's an example of a README file you can include in your calculator project.

## Features

- Addition: Adds two numbers and returns their sum.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another and returns the difference.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers and returns their product.
- Division: Divides one number by another and returns the quotient. Handles division by zero gracefully, displaying an error message if the second number is zero.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-python-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd basic-python-calculator
```

3. Run the calculator program.

```
python calculator.py
```

4. The program will display a menu with options for each operation. Enter the corresponding number to choose the desired calculation.

5. Follow the prompts to input the numbers and view the result.

6. After completing one calculation, the program will return to the menu, allowing you to perform additional calculations without restarting the program.
